  The website was meant to be a teasing website for people who wanted to get to know the <strong>Proximus network</strong>.
  For Proximus itself it was important that they could use this website as an entertaining website with some new and fancy things in it.
  The idea was to work on great content: <strong>cartoons</strong>, <strong>facts</strong> and <strong>information</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  The website has a detection build in to serve the <strong>mobile</strong> or the <strong>desktop</strong> website based on the browser.
  The main reason for doing so was the difference between the desktop and the mobile site.
  As you can see the desktop has a <strong>css 3D effect</strong> built into and the mobile site has a <strong>lazy loading scrolling</strong> system.
</p>
<p>
  We chose to separate the data with a rest service <a href='http://fuelphp.com/' target='_blank'>Fuelphp</a> and to work with <a href='http://backbonejs.org/' target='_blank'>Backbone.js</a> on the front-end.
  This gave us the ability to separate the <pr></pr>oject better in nicely <strong>encapsulated</strong> layers.
</p>
<p>
  You should <a href='http://bestnetwork.be/' target='_blank'>try it out</a>.

  This was another <strong>HTML5 game</strong> I developed for fun,
  to spend my time getting to know <strong>Javascript</strong>
  and the <strong>HTML5 canvas</strong> element.
</p>
<p>
  The main challenges were all the <strong>animations</strong> during the
  game and of course all the block <strong>collision detections</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  To add in another challenge I wanted to use the
  Facebook api to let users connect with their
  Facebook credentials. This is now deactivated.
</p>
<p>
  Feel free to <a href='http://games.robbiebardijn.be/tetris' target='_blank'> play the game </a>.

  The Hp Spectre project was a teasing website for people who wanted to buy a new <strong>Hp Spectre laptop</strong>.
  Conceptually the idea was to let people subscribe for a <strong>romantic date</strong> with an Hp Spectre laptop.
</p>
<p>
  When you registered and filled in the correct answers you could visit one of the resellers stores
  in your neighbourhood to win an <strong>Hp Spectre laptop</strong>.
  The website itself was build on <a href='http://limonade-php.github.io/' target='_blank' >limonade php</a> and connected with the Facebook SDK.
</p>
<p>
  The design was made by <a href='https://www.behance.net/guichtouch' target='_blank'>Guillaume Janne</a>, slick and beautiful.
  I worked with fade in / out animations between the questions,
  to give it a little touch. The website was also for a big part a SPA.
</p>
<p>
  The project is off-line.

  I wanted to experiment with the <strong>HTML5 canvas</strong> element.
  So I made a couple of games using the canvas.
</p>
<p>
  Canvas snake was one of them,
  the reason why I chose for snake was because
  I wanted to make a game that was <strong>not to easy</strong> to make,
  but also <strong>not to difficult</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  I learned some of my Javascript skills by making this game.
  The most difficult part was making the body, all its <strong>right turns</strong>
  and corresponding images, the rest was just a matter of <strong>timing</strong>.
  Another thing that was not so simple was the <strong>drop shadow</strong> on the snake.
</p>
<p>
  I'm glad I made this project in my spare time.
  Hope you enjoy <a href='http://games.robbiebardijn.be/games/canvassnake' target='_blank'>playing the game</a>.
  Don't forget to submit your score.

  This project was a <strong>teasing website</strong> for an artist called <a href='http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Der%C3%BClo' target='_blank'>Jason Der√ºlo</a>.
  It was a <strong>small</strong> project but was kinda fun to make.
</p>
<p>
  Yeah, it was in flash, that <strong>good old flash</strong>.
  I remember making the project in one week, together with jay at digital natives.
  Those colleagues were great, French people are great.
</p>
<p>
  I think many agencies made some kind of website where
  you <strong>upload</strong> or <strong>take a picture</strong> and then <strong>draw funny things </strong>around your picture.
  This was one of them.

  As first <strong>HTML5</strong> game I made the well known <strong>Asteroids</strong> game.
  This was just a simple game, no score submission,
  just playing until you are dead.
</p>
<p>
  It was just a matter of doing the <strong>right calculations</strong> and
  making good <strong>collision detections</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  This game was made while I read the <a href='http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920013327.do' target='_blank'>HTML5 canvas book</a> by O'reilly.
  It was a great book and also a great start in the direction of <strong>javascript</strong> and Canvas.

  <a href='https://www.facebook.com/jonathan.dupont.14?fref=ts' target='_blank'>Jonathan Dupont</a> and myself where put on the project
  because <strong>BBDO</strong> Digital was making a shift from <strong>.NET</strong> to <strong>Php</strong>.
  I stood in for the back-end and he made the front-end implementation.

  Main challenges for me where the <strong>authentication system</strong>, multiple <strong>user roles</strong>

  This was a project that was a restyling of the old website for <strong>Mercedes</strong> freemind.
  The website is meant for the owners of a <strong>Mercedes</strong> car who want to
  calculate and review their maintenance program for their car.
</p>
<p>
  The project was a ASP.net port to <a href='http://fuelphp.com/' target='_blank'>fuelphp</a>, an old Webservices
  is still beeing used for sending the emails and doing some of the calculations.
</p>
<p>
  The website is responsive and accessible for <strong>tablet</strong> and <strong>mobile</strong> device.
  Main challenges were the components and responsiveness of the website,
  because this was a decision that was made later on in the project.

  This was one of the larger projects that I had been part of at <strong>BBDO</strong>.<br>
  <a href='https://www.facebook.com/jonathan.pardon' target='_blank'>Jonathan Pardon</a>, <a href='https://www.behance.net/guichtouch' target='_blank'>Guillaume Janne</a> and myself
  worked together to create a very cool website for Champion.
</p>
<p>
  The basic idea was to catch as many rain as possible by creating a virtual route trough Europe visiting 5 cities.
  During one week we would measure the amount of rain from Acuweather to determine the winner.
</p>
<p>
  The project itself was split into 3 main periods:
  Registration and Route creation, the Game week and the Winner announcement week.
</p>
<p>
  The main challenges for me were the creation of the map and <strong>google maps</strong> implementation,
  the whole front-end which was a SPA build on <strong>backbone.js</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  You can still <a href='http://championrainhunters.com/' target='_blank'>visit the website</a>.<br>
  But the competition is now ended.
